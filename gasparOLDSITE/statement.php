IN  THIS  BODY  OF  WORK  THE  IMAGES  ARE  METAPHORS  FOR  PAGES  IN  A  VISUAL  NOVEL  PORTRAYING  A  SUBCULTURE  THAT  HAS  ENDURED  IN  THE  MEXICAN  AMERICAN  COMMUNITY  SINCE  THE  SECOND  WORLD  WAR.  ONE  IS  BORN  A  MEXICAN  AMERICAN,  BUT  ONE  CHOOSES  TO  BE  A  <i>CHICANO</i>.  POLITICALLY  CHARGED,  THE  <i>CHICANO</i>  LIFE  STYLE    HAS  BEEN  PASSED  FROM  ONE  GENERATION  TO  ANOTHER.  IT  HAS  SURVIVED  WARS,   PRISONS,   AND   STRIFE.<BR><BR>

THE  IMAGES  REFLECT  A  LIFE  STYLE  AND  AN  ATTITUDE  DOMINANT  IN  THE  BARRIOS.  THIS  STYLE  IS  IDENTIFIED  BY  THE  STYLE  OF  DRESS,  MANNERISM,  AND  LANGUAGE.  MANY <i>CHICANOS</i> USE A SLANG CALLED <i>CALO</i>  TO  COMMUNICATE  AND,  WHEN IT WAS ALLOWED,  MANY DEVELOPED THEIR OWN SIGN LANGUAGE  TO COMMUNICATE  WITH  LOVED  ONES  INCARCERATED  IN  THE  COUNTY  JAIL.  STANDING  IN  THE  STREETS  BELOW  THE  JAIL,  WOMEN  WOULD  SIGN  TO  THEIR  BOYFRIENDS  HELD  IN  CELLS ON  THE  UPPER  FLOORS.  THIS  ACTIVITY  NO  LONGER  TAKES  PLACE  SINCE  THE  WINDOWS  OF  THE  JAIL  HAVE  BEEN  COVERED.   <BR><BR>

THE  WORK  DEALS  WITH  INDIVIDUALS  WHOSE  LIVES  HAVE  BEEN  A  PART  OF  MY  ENVIRONMENT.  THEY  ARE  INDIVIDUALS  WHO  REMIND  ME  OF  FRIENDS  AND  ACQUAINTANCES  I GREW  UP  WITH .<BR><BR>

THE  WORK  IS  NOT  A  CRUSADE  TO  CHANGE  LIVES  NOR  IS  IT  AN  EFFORT  TO  PASS  JUDGEMENT.  IT  IS  UP  TO  THE  VIEWER  TO  JUDGE  AND   INTERPRET.  THESE  IMAGES  INVITES  THE  VIEWER  TO  COME  INTO  CONTACT  WITH  SOME  OF  THOSE  WHO  POPULATE  THE  CHICANO  WORLD.<BR><BR>

AS  LONG  AS  THERE  IS  POVERTY  EN  <i>EL  BARRIO</i>  ( IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD )  THIS  LIFE  STYLE  WILL  ENDURE  MY  GENERATION  AND  GENERATIONS  TO  COME .  AN  IDENTITY  IS  IMPORTANT  TO  ALL  OF  US.  THIS  LIFE  STYLE  REFLECTS  THE  AVENUE  SOME  INDIVIDUALS  TAKE,  SEARCHING  FOR  AN  IDENTITY  AND  SELF  ESTEEM .        <BR><BR>
